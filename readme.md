<h4>Hoses and Umbilicals</h4>
Script calculates Properties of Hoses and Umbilicals, used in Offshore industry./p>

<h5>Input Data</h5>
<u>Hoses:</u> Inner Diameter in milimeters.</p>
<u>Umbilicals:</u> Outer Diameter in milimeters</p>
<h6>Units</h6>
Script using **SI** system of units, **only**. As input diameters are given in milimeters and recalculated in meters for further processing, any consistent system will **not work**.</p>
<h5>Calculated properties</h5>
Script calculate following properties for High Pressure, Low Pressure and Fold - Flat hoses:</p>
* Outer Diameter in milimeters</p>
* Mass of hose per meter of length in metric ton per meter </p>
* Axial stiffness in kN</p>
* Bending Stiffness kN*sqm (sqm=square meter)</p>
Following properties will be calculated for Umbilicals:</p>
* Mass of umbilical per meter</p>
* Axial stiffnes in kN</p>
* Bending stiffnes in kN*sqm</p>
<h5>Results</h5>
Results are written in "hoses.txt" for hoses and "umbilical.txt" file for umbilicals, located in working folder.<p>
**Important Note**</p>
Calculation results are based on statistical data and are good for preliminary usage. Whenever "real" data are available, use them!</p>
